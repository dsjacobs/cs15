• Sum all (data are integers)
• Concat all (data are strings)
• Concat leaves (return a string that contains the concatenation of all the strings
in the leaves but nothing in internal nodes)
• postOrderDelete (this is something any tree destructor will do; why do we say
it’s probably best to do this using a post-order traversal?)
• Path to value: return “” is item is not in tree, otherwise return directions, like
“went left, went right, went right, went left, found it!” (Don’t worry about
punctuation and spacing — can just return a string like “LRRLTarget” where
Target is the item we’re looking for.)
